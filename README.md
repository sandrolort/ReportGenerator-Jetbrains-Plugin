# ReportGenerator Jetbrains Plugin

Plugin that integrates the ReportGenerator functionality into Jetbrains IDE as a tool window.

"ReportGenerator converts coverage reports generated by coverlet, OpenCover, dotCover, Visual Studio, NCover, Cobertura, JaCoCo, Clover, gcov, or lcov into human readable reports in various formats.
The reports show the coverage quotas and also visualize which lines of your source code have been covered."

- Install the global CLI tool by running `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool' before using the plugin.
- Install coverlet/coverlet.msbuild package in your test project.
- Click "Generate Report" button in the tool window. This will automatically run the tests and display the result.

The plugin currently only supports one test project at a time. Subject to change in future versions.
